(Question A) Compare the accuracy of both datasets, if the results are different, what explains the difference?

The new dataset has improved accuracy (for example: 0.78 for the original and 0.89 for the new dataset).
The new dataset has a larger mean separation and a smaller standard deviation. This reduces the overlap and increases the accuracy.


(Question B) What happens when you change the:

number of datapoints: If we increase the number of datapoints we get improved accuracy by providing better estimates of
the mean and the variance. This also means that fewer datapoints reduces the accuracy.

mean of the normal distributions: When the dataset has a larger mean separation it increases the accuracy, and when 
we lower the mean separation the dataset has decreased accuracy.

standard deviation of the normal distributions: When you increase the standard deviation the datapoints get generated further away from 
the mean, increasing overlap and becoming less accurate. Meaning that a lower standard deviation has a higher accuracy.
